Draft MVP Concept Description

Here is the structured concept based on our discussion and the provided PRD/UX Specs.

1. Core MVP Hypothesis/Goal

    Primary Hypothesis: We can provide a functional, self-hosted solution that allows a developer to install the platform (via Docker), visually design a template using basic elements, and successfully generate a static image via a local API call within 15 minutes.

    Learning Objective: Validate the technical reliability of the Fabric.js → Backend Renderer → MinIO pipeline without the complexity of authentication or multi-tenancy.

2. Target Audience (MVP Subset)

    The "Local" Developer: A developer looking to automate image generation (e.g., for Open Graph tags or email banners) who prefers running tools locally or on an internal network and does not currently need user management or security tokens.

3. Problem Solved (MVP Focus)

    Problem: Existing open-source solutions are either too complex (pure code) or lack a visual interface. SaaS tools are expensive.

    Solution: A "download and run" visual editor that outputs the exact JSON structure needed to programmatically generate images using their own storage (MinIO).

4. Minimum Feature Set (Prioritized)

IN (The Build List)

    Dashboard (Simplified): Simple grid view to List, Create, and Delete templates (Ref PRD 5.1).

    Editor - Canvas: Fabric.js implementation supporting Text (with auto-resize) and Images (upload/place) only.

    Editor - Properties Panel: UI to set variable names (e.g., title_text) and basic styles (Ref UX 3.2).

    Editor - Code View (Read-Only): A toggle to view and copy the current JSON schema to the clipboard for easy debugging (Ref UX Flow B - Modified).

    Backend Generation Engine: An unsecured REST endpoint accepting template_id + modifications to render the image.

    Storage Integration: Hard requirement to support MinIO/S3 environment variables for saving generated assets (Ref PRD 5.3).

    Dockerization: A basic docker-compose setup to spin up the App + MinIO (Ref PRD 6).

OUT (Explicitly Excluded)

    Authentication/Security: No API Keys, no Login/Logout, no User Accounts.

    Bi-Directional Editing: Writing code to update the canvas is out.

    Advanced Elements: No Shapes (Rectangles/Circles) or custom Fonts management (System fonts only).

    UX Bells & Whistles: No "History/Undo," no "Export to PNG" (direct from canvas), no mobile responsiveness.

5. Key Constraints (MVP Specific)

    Environment: Local/Private Network only (due to lack of Auth).

    Tech Stack: Must use Fabric.js (Frontend) and S3/MinIO SDK (Backend).

6. Success Metrics (Initial Idea)

    Technical Success: A test script can spin up the Docker container, create a template, and generate 10 unique images in < 60 seconds.

    Usability: A user can figure out the "Variable Name" mapping using only the "Read-Only JSON" view (without reading external docs).
